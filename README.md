### Question/Problem statement:  

Finding a job is considered one of the major activities for every one.Typically, large companies do not have enough time to open each CV, so we are help them by use machine learning algorithms for the Resume Screening task.The purpose of this project is to use the Natural Language Processing to parse information from a resume pdf files, find the keywords, cluster them onto sectors based on their keywords, in order to helping human resources to fill jobs with the right person .

### Data Description:  

we extracted the dataset from Kaggle website, the dataset contained 2485 rows and 4 columns: 
     (ID, Resume_str , Resume_html, Category ), with data type ( string , integer)
